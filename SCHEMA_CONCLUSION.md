# Schema Conclusion
> Final agreed database structure decisions. This is the single source of truth for all database design decisions.

---

## Global Design Decisions
- All primary keys use **UUID v7** — time-ordered, fast for inserts, timestamp embedded in ID
- All tables keep `created_at` alongside UUID v7 — UUID v7 handles ordering, `created_at` handles human-readable querying and Supabase tooling
- All tenant-owned tables carry `business_id` for Row Level Security (multi-tenancy)
- `branch_id` is planted as nullable on relevant tables — NULL = all branches, set = branch-specific (future franchise support)
- `channel_id` is planted as nullable on offers — NULL = all catalogues, set = specific catalogue/channel (future wholesale/retail split)
- **Unit rule:** All `unit` references use `unit_id UUID FK → units.id` — never plain text. This ensures unit conversions are always resolvable.
- **Category rule:** All `category` references use `category_id UUID FK → categories.id` — never plain text.

---

## Foundation Tables (Multi-Tenancy Core)

### Table 0a — `businesses`
The top-level tenant. Every other table traces back to this. One row per registered business.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `name` | TEXT | Business trading name |
| `owner_user_id` | UUID | FK → auth.users.id — the account owner |
| `subscription_plan` | TEXT | `'free'` / `'pro'` |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

---

### Table 0b — `branches`
Physical locations of a business. v1 starts with one default branch per business. v2 enables multi-branch.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `name` | TEXT | e.g. "Main Store", "Warehouse" |
| `address` | TEXT | Optional |
| `is_default` | BOOLEAN | True for the first/only branch |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Rule:** Every business gets exactly one default branch on signup. `branch_id` on other tables defaults to this branch's ID.

---

### Table 0c — `channels`
Sales channels — e.g. retail counter, wholesale, online. Used to separate pricing and offers per channel.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `name` | TEXT | e.g. "Retail", "Wholesale", "Online" |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**v1 rule:** Most businesses use one default channel (retail). `channel_id` is NULL on most tables in v1 — means "applies to all channels."

---

## Inventory

### Table 1 — `inventory_items`
The product identity. Shared information that never changes per variant or branch.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id (multi-tenancy) |
| `item_code` | TEXT | User-defined code |
| `name` | TEXT | Product name |
| `category_id` | UUID | FK → categories.id — replaces free-text category + subcategory |
| `unit_id` | UUID | FK → units.id — base unit of this item (KG, Pieces, etc.) |
| `has_expiry` | BOOLEAN | Is this perishable? |
| `expires_within_days` | INTEGER | Alert window before expiry |
| `taxes` | JSONB | `[{name, percentage, inclusive}]` |
| `image_url` | TEXT | Optional |
| `notes` | TEXT | Optional description |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Changed from original:**
- `category TEXT` + `subcategory TEXT` → removed, replaced with `category_id UUID FK → categories.id`
- `unit TEXT` → removed, replaced with `unit_id UUID FK → units.id`

---

### Table 2 — `attribute_definitions`
The attribute type names for an item (e.g. Size, Color). One row per attribute type per item.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `inventory_item_id` | UUID | FK → inventory_items.id |
| `name` | TEXT | e.g. Size, Color, Weight |
| `display_order` | INTEGER | Controls column order in UI |

**Unique constraint:** `(inventory_item_id, name)` — a product cannot have two "Size" attributes.

---

### Table 3 — `inventory_variants`
Each unique version of a product. Holds default pricing and thresholds.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `inventory_item_id` | UUID | FK → inventory_items.id |
| `variant_code` | TEXT | e.g. VAR-001 |
| `purchase_price` | DECIMAL | Latest or weighted-average cost price — convenience field, not source of truth once batches exist |
| `selling_price` | DECIMAL | Default selling price / MRP |
| `par_stock` | DECIMAL | Default minimum stock threshold |
| `availability_status` | TEXT | `'active'` / `'inactive'` |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

---

### Table 4 — `variant_attribute_values`
The actual attribute values per variant. Links each variant to its attribute definitions.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `variant_id` | UUID | FK → inventory_variants.id |
| `attribute_definition_id` | UUID | FK → attribute_definitions.id |
| `value` | TEXT | e.g. Large, Red, 500g |

---

### Table 5 — `variant_stock`
Stock quantity per variant. Branch-aware from day one — one row per variant now, one row per variant per branch later.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `variant_id` | UUID | FK → inventory_variants.id |
| `branch_id` | UUID | FK → branches.id — default branch in v1 |
| `current_stock` | DECIMAL | Live stock quantity |
| `selling_price_override` | DECIMAL | Overrides variant default if set |
| `par_stock_override` | DECIMAL | Overrides variant default if set |
| `availability_override` | TEXT | Overrides variant default if set |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-updated on every change |

**Unique constraint:** `(variant_id, branch_id)` — only one stock row per variant per branch. Prevents double-counting.

**Stock deduction rule (backend):** When processing a sale, always use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on this row inside a transaction. This prevents two simultaneous sales from both passing the stock check and over-selling. This is a backend code rule — the schema is designed correctly for it because having one row per variant+branch makes row-level locking possible.

---

### Override Rule
For `selling_price`, `par_stock`, and `availability_status` — always check `variant_stock` first. If the override column is `null`, fall back to the value in `inventory_variants`.

---

### Table 6 — `suppliers`
One row per vendor/supplier a business purchases from. Linked to batches, not to items — the same supplier can supply different items across different batches.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `name` | TEXT | Vendor/supplier name |
| `phone` | TEXT | Optional contact number |
| `email` | TEXT | Optional |
| `address` | TEXT | Optional |
| `notes` | TEXT | Optional — e.g. "Reliable for nuts, slow on spices" |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

---

### Table 7 — `inventory_batches`
One row per purchase batch of a variant. Tracks vendor, cost, quantity, and expiry at the batch level. Multiple batches can exist for the same variant — each with its own price, supplier, and expiry.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `variant_id` | UUID | FK → inventory_variants.id |
| `branch_id` | UUID | FK → branches.id — which branch received this batch |
| `supplier_id` | UUID | FK → suppliers.id — who you bought from |
| `purchase_price` | DECIMAL | Cost per unit in this batch |
| `quantity_received` | DECIMAL | How much came in |
| `quantity_remaining` | DECIMAL | How much is still unsold/unused |
| `expiry_date` | DATE | NULL if non-perishable — actual expiry of this batch |
| `batch_number` | TEXT | Optional — vendor's own batch/lot label |
| `received_at` | TIMESTAMP | When this batch was received |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Stock sync rule:** `variant_stock.current_stock` must equal the SUM of `quantity_remaining` across all active batches for that variant + branch. Both must be updated inside the same database transaction — never separately.

**Sale deduction (future):** Batches are picked using FEFO (first-expiry, first-out) for perishable items, or FIFO (first-in, first-out) for non-perishable.

```

---

## Catalogue

### Table 8 — `categories`
Handles both categories and subcategories in one table using a self-referencing `parent_id`. Shared between inventory and catalogue.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `name` | TEXT | e.g. "Nuts", "Cashews" |
| `parent_id` | UUID | NULL = top-level category, set = subcategory of that parent |
| `display_order` | INTEGER | Controls sort order in UI |
| `is_archived` | BOOLEAN | Soft delete — keeps data, hides from UI |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Rule:** Only one level of nesting — a subcategory cannot itself have children. Enforced in application layer.

---

### Table 9 — `tags`
Business-wide master list of tags. Tags are shared across the whole business — not locked to catalogue or inventory. One business owns its own set of tags.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `name` | TEXT | e.g. "seasonal", "bestseller", "gift" |
| `color` | TEXT | Optional hex color for UI display |
| `description` | TEXT | Optional — what this tag means |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Why not a TEXT array on catalogue_items:** Separate table allows analytics by tag, rename propagates instantly, clean metadata for vector DB injection, and tags can be applied to any entity (not just catalogue items).

---

### Table 10 — `entity_tags`
Bridge table connecting tags to any entity in the system — catalogue items today, inventory items or customers in future. Uses `entity_type` to know what it's tagging.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `tag_id` | UUID | FK → tags.id |
| `entity_type` | TEXT | `'catalogue_item'` / `'inventory_item'` / `'customer'` / extensible |
| `entity_id` | UUID | The ID of whatever is being tagged |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Index:** `(entity_type, entity_id)` composite — how you find all tags for a given item.

**Cleanup rule (backend trigger):** When any tagged entity is deleted, a database trigger deletes its `entity_tags` rows. The database cannot enforce this as a FK because the target table varies per row — a trigger is the correct fix.

---

### Table 11 — `catalogue_items`
The menu — one row per thing a business sells. Three types: linked (1 inventory item), bundle (multiple inventory items), independent (service, no stock).

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `name` | TEXT | e.g. "Cashew 100g" |
| `category_id` | UUID | FK → categories.id |
| `type` | TEXT | `'linked'` / `'bundle'` / `'independent'` |
| `selling_price` | DECIMAL | Default price — treated as override base for channels |
| `taxes` | JSONB | `[{name, percentage, inclusive}]` |
| `tax_inclusive` | BOOLEAN | Is tax already inside the selling price? |
| `inventory_tracking` | BOOLEAN | Should a sale deduct stock? Always false for independent |
| `availability_status` | TEXT | `'active'` / `'inactive'` / `'archived'` |
| `notes` | TEXT | Internal notes |
| `branch_id` | UUID | NULL = visible in all branches, set = this branch only |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Type rule:** `type` is stored explicitly for query performance, but is always consistent with the number of component rows — 0 components = independent, 1 = linked, 2+ = bundle.

---

### Table 12 — `catalogue_components`
The recipe. Links each catalogue item to the inventory items it uses, with quantity and unit per sale.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `catalogue_item_id` | UUID | FK → catalogue_items.id |
| `inventory_item_id` | UUID | FK → inventory_items.id |
| `quantity_used` | DECIMAL | How much to deduct per unit sold |
| `unit_id` | UUID | FK → units.id — the unit `quantity_used` is measured in. NULL = use inventory item's native unit |
| `display_order` | INTEGER | Order shown in UI for bundles |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Changed from original:** `unit TEXT` → `unit_id UUID FK → units.id`

**Unit conversion rule:** If `unit_id` differs from the inventory item's `unit_id`, use `unit_conversions` to convert before deducting stock. If `unit_id` is NULL, deduct directly in the inventory item's native unit.

---

### Table 13 — `catalogue_component_variants`
Controls which specific variants of an inventory item are selectable at POS for a given component. If no rows exist for a component, all variants are available.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `catalogue_component_id` | UUID | FK → catalogue_components.id |
| `variant_id` | UUID | FK → inventory_variants.id |

---

### Table 14 — `offers`
Deals and promotions. `benefit_type` is a plain label. `benefit_config` is JSONB — stores the actual rules for that offer type. Adding new offer types in future requires zero database changes.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `channel_id` | UUID | NULL = all channels, set = specific channel only |
| `name` | TEXT | e.g. "Buy 3 Get 1 Free" |
| `min_quantity` | INTEGER | Minimum cart quantity to trigger this offer |
| `benefit_type` | TEXT | Label — see benefit types below |
| `benefit_config` | JSONB | Rules for that type — any shape |
| `active` | BOOLEAN | Is this offer currently running? |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Benefit types and their config shape:**

| benefit_type | benefit_config example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `percentage_discount` | `{"value": 10}` | 10% off total |
| `flat_discount` | `{"value": 500}` | ₹500 off total |
| `fixed_price` | `{"value": 230}` | Whole combo for ₹230 |
| `free_item` | `{"select": "cheapest"}` | Cheapest item is free |
| `buy_x_get_y` | `{"buy_item_id": "x", "buy_qty": 3, "get_item_id": "y", "get_qty": 1}` | Buy 3 get 1 specific item free |
| `tiered_pricing` | `{"tiers": [{"min": 1, "max": 5, "price": 90}, {"min": 6, "price": 80}]}` | Price drops as quantity rises |

New offer types can be added by defining a new label and config shape — no migration needed.

---

### Table 15 — `offer_items`
Bridge between offers and catalogue items. Defines which items qualify for an offer.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `offer_id` | UUID | FK → offers.id |
| `catalogue_item_id` | UUID | FK → catalogue_items.id |

---

## Units

### Table 16 — `units`
Master list of measurement units per business. Businesses can create custom units. Units are locked once used in inventory to prevent data inconsistency.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `name` | TEXT | e.g. "Kilogram" |
| `abbreviation` | TEXT | e.g. "KG" |
| `allows_decimal` | BOOLEAN | Can you sell 1.5 of this? Yes for KG, No for Pieces |
| `is_locked` | BOOLEAN | True once used in inventory — cannot be deleted |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

---

### Table 17 — `unit_conversions`
Conversion factors between units. Only one direction needs to be defined — the system calculates the reverse automatically.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `from_unit_id` | UUID | FK → units.id |
| `to_unit_id` | UUID | FK → units.id |
| `factor` | DECIMAL | Multiply from_unit by this to get to_unit |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Example:** from=KG, to=Grams, factor=1000 → means 1 KG = 1000 Grams. System automatically knows 1 Gram = 0.001 KG.

**Unique constraint:** `(business_id, from_unit_id, to_unit_id)` — only one conversion per pair per business. Prevents two entries with conflicting factors for the same unit pair.

---

### Catalogue Relationships
```
categories (parent_id → self)
tags → entity_tags (entity_type + entity_id → anything)

catalogue_items (business_id, branch_id, category_id → categories)
  ├── catalogue_components (unit_id → units)
  │     └── catalogue_component_variants → inventory_variants
  └── offer_items ←── offers (business_id, channel_id → channels)

units → unit_conversions
      UNIQUE (business_id, from_unit_id, to_unit_id)
```

---

## POS

### Table 18 — `customers`
One row per customer per business. Searchable by name or phone at POS. Tags applied via `entity_tags` (entity_type = 'customer') — no separate column needed.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `name` | TEXT | Full name — searchable at POS |
| `phone` | TEXT | Primary lookup identifier |
| `email` | TEXT | Optional |
| `birthday` | DATE | Optional — for future loyalty and seasonal offers |
| `address` | TEXT | Optional — for future delivery support |
| `notes` | TEXT | e.g. "Bulk buyer, prefers cashews" |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Unique constraint:** `(business_id, phone)` — one customer record per phone number per business. Prevents duplicates on POS lookup.

---

### Table 19 — `sales`
One row per completed transaction. The bill header. Walk-in sales allowed — `customer_id` is nullable but always populated when customer is known.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `branch_id` | UUID | FK → branches.id |
| `customer_id` | UUID | NULL = walk-in, set = known customer |
| `subtotal` | DECIMAL | Total before bill-level discount |
| `bill_discount_amount` | DECIMAL | Discount applied to the whole bill |
| `bill_discount_type` | TEXT | `'flat'` / `'percentage'` — CHECK constraint enforced |
| `tax_total` | DECIMAL | Total tax collected |
| `final_amount` | DECIMAL | What the customer actually paid |
| `payment_method` | TEXT | `'cash'` / `'upi'` / `'card'` — CHECK constraint enforced |
| `notes` | TEXT | Optional note on the sale |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set — this is the sale timestamp |

**Scaling note:** This table grows forever. Plan for monthly partitioning by `created_at` before it exceeds 500k rows. Always filter queries with a date range — this keeps queries fast by only scanning one month's data at a time.

---

### Table 20 — `sale_items`
One row per line item on the bill. Prices and names are snapshotted at time of sale so history stays accurate even if catalogue changes later.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `sale_id` | UUID | FK → sales.id |
| `catalogue_item_id` | UUID | FK → catalogue_items.id |
| `variant_id` | UUID | FK → inventory_variants.id — NULL if no variant |
| `catalogue_item_name` | TEXT | Snapshot — name at time of sale |
| `quantity` | DECIMAL | How many units sold |
| `unit_price` | DECIMAL | Snapshot — price at time of sale |
| `cost_price_at_sale` | DECIMAL | Snapshot — cost price for profit calculation |
| `item_discount_amount` | DECIMAL | Discount applied to this line item |
| `tax_amount` | DECIMAL | Tax on this line item |
| `line_total` | DECIMAL | Final amount after discount + tax |
| `applied_offer_id` | UUID | NULL = no offer, set = offer that gave this discount |
| `stock_deducted` | BOOLEAN | False in v1 — activates in v2 when stock logic runs |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Snapshot rule:** `catalogue_item_name`, `unit_price`, and `cost_price_at_sale` are copied at the moment of sale and never updated. Historical accuracy depends on this.

**Offer analytics note:** `applied_offer_id` is stored now so "offer X discounted item Y N times" is queryable in future without any schema change.

---

### Table 21 — `stock_movements`
Audit log of every stock change. Append-only — never update or delete rows here. Table created in v1, write logic activates in v2.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID v7 | Primary key |
| `business_id` | UUID | FK → businesses.id |
| `variant_id` | UUID | FK → inventory_variants.id |
| `branch_id` | UUID | FK → branches.id |
| `movement_type` | TEXT | `'sale'` / `'purchase'` / `'manual_adjustment'` / `'waste'` |
| `quantity_change` | DECIMAL | Negative = stock out, Positive = stock in |
| `reference_id` | UUID | The sale ID or purchase ID that caused this movement |
| `reference_type` | TEXT | `'sale'` / `'purchase'` / `'manual'` |
| `notes` | TEXT | Optional reason for manual adjustments |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Auto-set |

**Scaling note:** This table grows faster than `sales` — every sale creates multiple movement rows. Plan for monthly partitioning by `created_at` before it exceeds 1M rows.

---

### POS Relationships
```
customers (business_id)
  └── entity_tags (entity_type = 'customer') ← tags

sales (business_id, branch_id → branches, customer_id → customers)
  └── sale_items
        ├── catalogue_item_id → catalogue_items
        ├── variant_id        → inventory_variants
        └── applied_offer_id  → offers

sale_items → stock_movements (v2)
```

## Required Unique Constraints

> These rules must exist in the database, not just in the app. The database will reject duplicates before they can be saved.

| Table | Unique Constraint | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `variant_stock` | `(variant_id, branch_id)` | One stock row per variant per branch — prevents double-counting |
| `customers` | `(business_id, phone)` | No duplicate customer per phone number |
| `unit_conversions` | `(business_id, from_unit_id, to_unit_id)` | Only one factor per unit pair — prevents conflicting conversions |
| `attribute_definitions` | `(inventory_item_id, name)` | No duplicate attribute names per product |

---

## Required Indexes

> An index is like the index at the back of a book — instead of reading every row, the database jumps straight to the matching ones. Every column you filter or sort by needs one.
